# Car Searcher

This is a **Car Searcher** project built with **JavaScript**. It allows users to search for cars based on multiple attributes such as brand, model, year, number of doors, color, transmission type, and price range. The results are dynamically filtered based on user input.

## Features

- **Search by Multiple Filters**: 
  - Brand
  - Year
  - Number of doors
  - Color
  - Transmission type (e.g., manual, automatic)
  - Price range
  
- **Dynamic Filtering**: As users enter their search criteria, the results are automatically filtered without the need to refresh the page.
- **Car Listings**: Displays car details such as brand, model, year, number of doors, color, transmission type, and price.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Input fields for each search criterion and an easy-to-navigate layout.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**: For handling the logic and implementing dynamic filtering.
- **HTML/CSS**: For the layout and styling of the user interface.
- **JSON**: To simulate a database of car listings (can be replaced with an actual API in a real-world scenario).
