# ToDo List with LocalStorage and TypeScript

This is a simple and functional ToDo List application built with **TypeScript**, which allows you to:

- Add tasks to the list.
- Mark tasks as completed (they will be visually crossed out).
- Remove tasks from the list.
- Persist tasks using **LocalStorage** so they won't be lost when the page is reloaded.

## Features

- **TypeScript**: Type-safe code for better robustness and maintainability.
- **LocalStorage**: Data persistence in the browser.
- **Interactive UI**: Mark tasks as completed or remove them easily.
